## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

P.S: Yeah, it was very basic.
### What I learned

I learned a lot of design with CSS!


```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

I really don't know what I should do next, so please guys give me some good idea...

### Useful resources
